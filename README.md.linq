# Cassandra

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra
Cassandra has two timelines.
One in which she will listen to events in the future (destruction of Troy)
The Trojans, if they believe her, will not let the trojan horse into Troy
and therefore avoid destruction of their city. If they do believe her, they will not allow the horse in
