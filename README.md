# Cassandra

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra

Cassandra has a gift, she can see herself in the future. Or, in this implementation, send messages back in time to her former self. 
Which is a good thing, since in the future, the Trojans will let the Trojan Horse into their city, leading to her being raped and abducted. 

If she gets a message from herself, she will warn the Trojans. If they are skeptics, they will not believe her, and
thus preserve space-time (as in the legend). However, if we change the legend so that they believe her, they will alter history by not letting
the horse in. This will lead to a space-time paradox, because Trojans will then be both dead and alive at the same point in time in the future.

## Output with Skeptics=true
```shell
Horse: Look at us, nice present, yes?
Trojans: What a nice horse. It must be a present. Open the gates
Cassandra: Ajax the Lesser, you stink!
I should warn myself!
Cassandra: You must never open for the horse. It's a trap
Horse: Look at us, nice present, yes?
Trojans: We have been warned
But we don't listen to that crazy women!
Trojans: What a nice horse. It must be a present. Open the gates
Cassandra: Ajax the Lesser, you stink!
A few months passed, demonstrating that time is moving side-by-side
A few months passed, demonstrating that time is moving side-by-side
Present and future are now in sync
Time and space is still in order
```

## Output with Skeptics=true
```shell
Horse: Look at us, nice present, yes?
Trojans: What a nice horse. It must be a present. Open the gates
Cassandra: Ajax the Lesser, you stink!
I should warn myself!
Cassandra: You must never open for the horse. It's a trap
Horse: Look at us, nice present, yes?
Trojans: We have been warned
Trojans: We have been warned from the future. We know your cunning plan!
A few months passed, demonstrating that time is moving side-by-side
A few months passed, demonstrating that time is moving side-by-side
Present and future are now in sync
But we are both dead and alive. This is a paradox!

# Time Loop logic

This would be very fun to implement... Next up.
