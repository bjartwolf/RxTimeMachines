# Cassandra

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra

Cassandra has a gift, she can listen to herself in the future. Or, currently, send messages back in time to herself.
If she gets a message from herself, she will warn the Trojans. If they are skeptics, they will not believe her, and
thus preserve space-time. However, if they believe her, they will alter history. This will lead to a space-time paradox,
because Trojans will then be both dead and alive at the same time in the future.

# Time Loop logic

This would be very fun to implement
